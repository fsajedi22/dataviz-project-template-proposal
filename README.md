# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is Religion by Country that can be found here: https://github.com/curran/data/blob/gh-pages/pew/religion/religionByCountry.csv

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a stacked bar graph and each of the different colors represent different religions. Along the y-axis are the different countries.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How are religions distributed between countries?
 * Which religion is the most popular in the world?
 * How does one country compare to another?
 * How does a specific religion vary through out the countries?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

How to add a filter?
How to add multiple filters?
