# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is Religion by Country that can be found here: https://github.com/curran/data/blob/gh-pages/pew/religion/religionByCountry.csv

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a stacked bar graph and each of the different colors represent different religions. Along the y-axis are the different countries.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How are religions distributed between countries?
 * Which religion is the most popular in the world?
 * How does one country compare to another?
 * How does a specific religion vary through out the countries?

## Sketches

The sketches below were the very preliminary sketches. I was thinking of a world map and then have more information at each country. I also had the bar chart idea, but it was not flushed out. There were no interactions thought of at this point.

After looking at the data and thinking through the bar chart more, I came up with the sketch below. Here I have the interaction where the user cal filter the religion. I later thought of alos being able to filter the country.
